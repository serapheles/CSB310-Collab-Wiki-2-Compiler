A compiler is a software tool created to translate source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level programming language or machine code that can be understood by a computer. Its purpose is to annex the gap between the human readable high-level code and machine-readable low-level code. A few steps are needed to create a compiler such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The lexical analysis breaks the source code into a sequence of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and constants. Syntax analysis verifies the arrangement of tokens according to grammar rules of the programming language, checking for syntax errors. This step is generated by a parse tree or abstract syntax tree. Semantic analysis checks to ensure the correctness of code semantically. It checks for type compatibility, variable declarations, scoping rules, and other specific rules. Intermediate code generation the compiler generates an intermediate representation of source code, such as an intermediate language or bytecode which is closer to the machine code. Optimization, the compiler applies various techniques to improve efficiency and performance of the generated code. This helps to eliminate unnecessary code, optimizing usage and applying logic and mathematical transformations. Code generation the compiler translates the optimized intermediate code into the target matching code or executable file for a specific hardware platform. 
In the tech world compilers have a long history, dating back to the 50â€™s. The first compiler ever created was the A-0 system and it was completed in 1952 by a team led by Grace Hopper. The A-0 system was a set of instructions that could translate symbolic mathematical code into machine language. In producing A-0, she collected subroutines collected over the years and put them on ta pe. Each routine was given a call number, so that it the machine could find it on the tape. After the A-0 system, Grace and her team developed A-1 and A-2, which were improvements over the A-0. The A-2 compiler was the first ever compiler to be used extensively, making the way for the development of programming languages. Soon after other languages were developed such as FORTRAN developed in 1954 by John Backus at IMB, ALGOL, 1958 developed by an international committee, COBOL developed by Gracie Hopper in 1959, C developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie etc. These early developments in compiler technology laid foundation for the modern programming landscape, where compilers continue to be essential tools in software development, enabling programmers to write code in higher-level-languages while generating machine code for various platforms.
